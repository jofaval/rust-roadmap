# Rust Roadmap

The official guide is at: [https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book)

## Motivation

I want to learn Rust, thanks to it's popularity, and to ThePrimeagen

## Instructions

To set-up the content structure I've created the [`chapter-index-crawler.js`](./chapter-index-crawler.js). You can use it to generate files inside a folder, I've done it in a `roadmap` one.
